# Manim Tikz

Converts Tikz markup code into an `SVGMobject` for use in `manim`.

# Installation

We recommend having the latest version of `manim` using the `svgelements` library for SVG rendering, though older versions will probably work. `manim-tikz` ba installed from PyPI using `pip`:

```py
pip install manim-tikz
```

# Usage

`manim-tikz` adds the subclass `Tikz` to the `manim` class `SVGMobject`, as well as the subclass `TikzTemplate` to the `manim` class `TexTemplate` behind the scenes for `Tikz` to use.

To convert Tikz markup code into an `SVGMobject`, import `Tikz` from the `manim-tikz` library:

```py
from manim import *
from manim-tikz import Tikz
```

Then when constructing a `Scene` in `manim`, define a `Tikz` object like so:

```py
tikz_image = Tikz(code, [packages], [libaries], [tikzset], preamble, use_pdf)
```

- **`code`**: The Tikz code to render, as a `string`.
- **`[packages]`** *(optional)*: A list of `string` for additional LaTeX packages to include in the preamble, added using the `\usepackage` command. For example, if you include any special fonts or symbols in your Tikz picture, like `marvosym`.
- **`[libraries]`** *(optional)*: A list of `string` for any Tikz libraries you require to render your Tikz picture, such as `positioning`, `arrows.meta` or `calc`. These will be added to the preamble using the `\usetikzlibrary` command.
- **`[tikzset]`** *(optional)*: A list of `string` for any style definitions and similar you want to define before the Tikz picture (see the Tikz/PGF package [manual](https://tikz.dev/]) for further details). Added to the preamble using the `\tikzset` command.
- **`preamble`** *(optional)*: A `string` any other commands you wish to add to the preamble, such as setting up package options. Be careful, making a mistake here can easily result in errors!
- **`use_pdf`** *(optional, `False` by default)*: By default, `manim-tikz` will render the Tikz markup to a DVI file, which is them imported into `manim`. However, some drawing commands generated by Tikz do not render properly in DVI and require postscript (PDF). Setting this option to `True` will render to a PDF file instead, so use this option if there are problems with the output.

# Example

```py
from manim import *
from manim_tikz import Tikz

class TikzScene(Scene):
    def construct(self):

        test_tex = Tikz(r"\draw[magenta, line width=10mm, fill=blue] (0,0) rectangle(1,1);", use_pdf=False)

        self.add(test_tex)
```
